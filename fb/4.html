                Make sure you are using the same email address and password you registered with.<br>
                If you can't remember your password, click on the 'forgotten password' link on the <br>sign in page. You'll be prompted to enter your email address and we'll send you an email with a link that<br> will allow you to create a new password for your account.
               <br> If you enter your email address and/or password incorrectly three times,<br> your account will be locked for 30 minutes.
                If you set up your ASOS account using Twitter as your sign in method, <br>you’ll now need to use one of the following options:
                
                Know your password? Log in using your email address<br> (the one linked to your Twitter account) and your ASOS password. 
                Don’t have an ASOS password or forgotten it? Click on the 'forgotten password'<br> link on the sign in page. You'll be prompted to enter your email address (make sure you use the one linked to your Twitter account) <br>and we'll send you an email with a link that will allow you to create a new password.<br>
                Remember, you can no longer log in with Twitter. You can still choose to log <br>in with your email or use Google, Facebook or Apple. 
                 
                If your issue isn't password-related, <br>here are a few things you may want to check:
                
                Make sure that the 'Block all cookies' function <br>is disabled in your browser's settings
                Check that Javascript is enabled in your browser's settings.<br>
                Make sure that you don't have any content blockers installed.<br>
                Make sure that your device clock is accurate. For security reasons, if your device clock is fast, you won't be able<br> to access your account. You can resolve this problem easily by setting the time on your device to default.
                 
                
               <br> If, after this, you still can't sign in, contact our Customer Care Team and give,<br>them as much detail as you can about the issue, including screen shots of any error message you receive <br>and what you've done so far to try to resolve the issue at hand.</a></li>
